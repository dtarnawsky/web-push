# Ionic App with Web Push Notifications
This is a quick start project for Ionic which includes the ability to do web push notifications

Note: If copying code you need to specify your own settings in firebase-messaging-sw.js, environment.ts and environment.prod.ts as the project does not include the apiKey required to run (you can't use my firebase credentials)
